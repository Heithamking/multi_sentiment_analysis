       "1040  requires account to use i was just giving a simple reason why i didnt like it but since your response indicates i dont have seconds then ill waist minutes to make you understand the point is that it requires an account i dont need another stinking account to keep track of a task list if i wanted to share on multiple devices i would just use any number of desktop applications that i already own i dont need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of backing up my data or make it available everywhere i have that covered already just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone but without that choice no thanks to act as though seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless i decide i want to do that that is what you need to understand some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat downloaded tasks todo list and been happy with it donated to developer for making app for me and not their self   \n",
